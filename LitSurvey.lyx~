\begin_layout Abstract
Distance relay zone 3 misoperation has been responsible for major blackouts
 around the world.
 Zone 3 misoperation generally occurs under system wide cascading events
 such as the 2003 Northeastern US-Canada blackout or under stressed system
 conditions such as the 2015 Turkish blackout.
 This paper summarizes the problem and provides a survey on the research
 efforts made to increase distance relay security to prevent distance protection
 misoperation.

\begin_layout Standard
With the deregulated market structure in the United States and Europe, grid
 operators are under more pressure to reap more profits of existing infrastructu
re due to increased competition.
 The grid is thus increasingly operated near the threshold of stability.
 Failure of the grid, better known as blackouts, carries catastrophic economic
 and societal sequences.
 Large blackouts tend to be due to either extreme natural events such as
 hurricanes or a series of events called cascading failures 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Hines2009"

\end_inset

.
 In this paper, we only focus on cascading events.
 Those events can be any of the following: line tripping, overloading of
 other lines, malfunctions of protection systems, power oscillations and
 voltage instability 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Yamashita"

\end_inset

.
 The reason that is considered in this paper is distance protection misoperation
 which is a contributing factor in seventy percent of all cascading events
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Chen2005"

\end_inset

.
 If not discovered and mitigated in an early stage, cascading events generally
 lead to a complete blackout.
 With today’s society much dependence on electricity as a form of energy,
 preventing such damage is detrimental.

Cascading failures are defined as “a sequence of dependent failures of individua

 Since the 2003 US-Canada blackout, cascading events have drawn much attention
 in the industrial and academic community.
 Even though, the world has witnessed many blackouts prior to the 2003 blackout
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Hines2009,Hines,Liscouski2004"

\end_inset

, the dramatic causes and consequences of the 2003 blackout have left industrial
 and academic community with the burden of exploring this phenomenon in
 more detail.
 To understand the severity of the 2003 blackout 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Liscouski2004"

\end_inset

, it sufficient to say it had caused the loss of 62 GW which caused the
 lights to turn off in the houses of more than 51 million people in the
 eastern interconnection.
 Considering the many components and the bits and pieces involved, a domino
 effect of events evolved slowly (hours) or fast (seconds) according to
 the region causing a degradation of the integrity of the system leading
 ultimately to a complete blackout.
 Daunting efforts had to be exerted to gain more knowledge and understanding
 of the underlying phenomenon.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Relays by design act quickly to remove the fault from the system by disconnectin
g faulted lines.
 However, sometimes relays fail to perform such function which is considered
 a protection system misoperation.
 Of all protection system misoperations that lead to cascading events, this
 paper focuses exclusively on distance protection misoperation.
 A protection system misoperation is defined as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

a failure to operate as intended for protection purposes

.
 Various categories are given for misoperation in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "NERCMisoperation"

\end_inset

.
 However, in this proposal the word misoperation will be used exclusively
 to mean only one of them, namely, an operation in which a protection system
 trips a healthy line when no fault exists.
 Notable cascading events 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Yamashita,Novosel2004"

\end_inset

 begin with lines that were tripped due to actual faults.
 The tripping of those faulty line causes the current flowing in those lines
 to be redistributed to adjacent lines.
 Those lines may be overloaded and thus tripped incorrectly -protection
 misoperation- which will trigger a sequence of cascading events that might
 ultimately lead to a blackout.
 It should be noted that regardless of the initial triggering events- whether
 a fault or not- that cause cascading events, historically those cascading
 events were triggered under stressful system conditions

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Yamashita"

\end_inset

, one of the effective ways to prevent cascading events is to specify potential
 undesirable relay operations ahead of time.
 In this paper, we show that even though distance protection misoperation
 can be anticipated ahead of time, prevention of this misoperation is not
 possible with distance protection principle only because the distance protectio
n principle is not able to be selective in some regions of its operation.

 provides a sample distance relay that is set according to NERC standards.
 Once this relay is set according to NERC directives, it will be explained
 in the same section that the relay may still misoperate.

 problem of distance protection zone 3 misoperation.

As can be seen from the examples in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "2015Turkish,Liscouski2004"

\end_inset

 in which distance protection misoperation have been the main cause of the
 blackouts or in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Abdullah"

\end_inset

 in which distance protection misoperation have been created in the IEEE
 118 bus system , a distance protection misoperation is characterized by
 a distance protection system seeing a heavy load on a line as a fault.
 This confusion arises from the fact that the impedance measured by the
 impedance protection system coincides with that of a fault.
 The reason for the heavy load can be due to load shifting after a fault
 as in the 2003 US-Canada blackout 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Liscouski2004"

\end_inset

 or due to lines out of service for maintenance causing one line to carry
 substantial system power transfer as in the 2015 Turkish blackout 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "2015Turkish"

\end_inset

 or due to any unforeseen reasons.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate that this confusion is not tied up with a certain system condition
 but rather inherent insecurity in the distance protection principle, the
 single line diagram shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:System-Configuration-for-formulating-problem"

\end_inset

 is used to formulate the problem in general terms.
 It will be shown below that this insecurity always exists and the degraded
 system conditions only excite it; that is, for some regions in the impedance
 protection zone the protection system is not able to be selective between
 a fault and non-fault condition.
 Without the degraded system conditions, it is highly unlikely that a distance
 protection misoperates.
 Even though, degraded system conditions can be anticipated in the planning
 stage, the system operator will have nothing in hand to prevent a distance
 protection misoperation if distance protection is used alone.
 It is important to keep in mind that distance protection systems are set
 locally with the help of the impedance of adjacent lines without any informatio
n about the system load until the coordination study phase.
 In the coordination study phase, the transmission line owner checks all
 settings against applicable standards.
 This is explained in detail in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "thompson2015transmission"

\end_inset

.
 In the following paragraphs, we will set up the relay settings first then
 discuss what happens in system wide cascading events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted

\end_inset

, the distance protection relay that will be studied is the relay at point
 A of line A-C.
 Line A-C is connected to three (3) lines, namely C-M, C-N and C-P.
 The number of lines connected to line A-C will not affect zone1 or zone
 2 settings but will affect zone 3 settings.
 As will be seen below, the more lines connected to line A-C, tripping in
 Zone 3 becomes more insecure.
 To simplify the analysis, all lines are assumed to have the same impedance
 as well as the short circuit level.
 However, as will be explained below, this simplification does not affect
 the generality of the problem formulation.
 The impedance and the rating of the lines are taken from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "NERC2003"

\end_inset

.
 The setting of zone 1 is assumed to be 0.85 of the line impedance.
 Zone 2 is assumed to be 1.2 of the line impedance.
 However, some consideration is needed to set up the third zone.
 The third zone has to be set such that it can protect the longest adjacent
 line (assumed to be line C-P in this case) and to protect 20% beyond that
 line to provide backup to the remote circuit breakers .
 In case of a bolted three phase fault on line C-P and assuming that the
 short circuit contributions of all buses is given in

This ends setting up the relay locally.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After setting up the relay locally, engineers need to apply applicable standards
 and directives to their settings for compliance purposes.
 This step involves running worst case power flow in the summer peak case.
 The most notable directive is the load encroachment.
 The load encroachment zone is an area of the protection zone in which the
 load impedance “ encroaches” –intrudes- upon the fault impedance.
 Load encroachment will obviously cause misoperation and should be removed
 from the zone of protection.
 To plot the load encroachment zone according to NERC directives 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "NERCLoadability,NERC2003,NERCMisoperation"

\end_inset

, the load zone should include the point which corresponds to 150% line
 loading and 0.85 per unit voltage.
 Thus the load encroachment locus of the distance relay at A will consist
 of two parts.
 The first part will be an arc of circle of radius given in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:LoadImpedance"

\end_inset

 which is given as arc 
\series bold
RIT
\series default
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:System-Configuration-for-formulating-problem"

\end_inset

.
 This arc 
\series bold
RIT
\series default
 corresponds to the least impedance that the relay should not issue a trip
 command for.
 The load lines will be two lines making an angle of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm30^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 with the x-axis (
\begin_inset Formula $\pm30^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 represents the power factor of the line under worst case loading condition)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Z_{load}=\frac{V_{A}}{I_{A}}=\frac{\frac{345kV}{\sqrt{3}}\times0.85}{1.5\times3000}=57\varOmega\label{eq:LoadImpedance}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The orange area 
\series bold
RLQT
\series default
 is the load encroachment area.
 NERC directives 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "NERCLoadability,NERC2003,NERCMisoperation"

\end_inset

 states that this load encroachment zone has to be removed from the relay
 operating zone.
 It can be seen at once that if the impedance seen by the relay lies within
 the green area 
\series bold
URI
\series default
 then a relay may confuse this operating point for a fault since the point
 lies already in zone 3.
 This confusion arises if the fault resistance is high enough to cause the
 fault point to lie within the green area 
\series bold
URI
\series default
.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Distance-Relay-characteristic"

\end_inset

, this fault resistance ranges from 
\begin_inset Formula $30\varOmega$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $90\varOmega$
\end_inset

.
 The fault resistance can be obtained by measuring the distance between
 the diameter 
\series bold
AB
\series default
 of zone 3 circle to point 
\series bold
R
\series default
 and 
\series bold
U
\series default
 of the green zone.
 If it is known in advance that the fault resistance calculated cannot be
 attained along the route of the transmission line, then the risk of misoperatio
n is nonexistence and the green area can be removed from zone 3 without
 affecting the security or reliability of the distance protection system.
 However, fault resistance along the route of the transmission line is not
 known in advance.
 Also, one should note that solid state and electromagnetical relays can
 not be programmed, only microprocessor relays can.
 This really means that older relays will have to comply with NERC standards
 by disabling zone 3 altogether.
 It is shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Horowitz2006"

\end_inset

 that disabling zone 3 in some cases will force protection engineers to
 provide back up protection solutions to remote circuit breakers.
 This might involve a considerable cost.
 Additionally, not all countries around the world have standards as strict
 as NERC, so the green area 
\series bold
URI 
\series default
exist in the zone of protection without regard from the settings engineer.
 Lastly, even if the relay complies with NERC directives, an impedance can
 still fall anywhere in zone 3, not only the green area 
\series bold
URI,
\series default
 under stressed system conditions as Phadke and Horowitz pointed out in
 their paper 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Horowitz2006"

\end_inset

.
 This shows clearly the impedance protection is inherently insecure under
 stresses system conditions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Attention is now given to the assumptions stated in the beginning.
 It was assumed that all lines have the same impedance and all of them are
 contributing equal currents to the fault.
 It can be seen at once from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Distance-Relay-characteristic"

\end_inset

 that this assumption is not restricting the generality of the problem formulati
on.
 Because in any case the green area 
\series bold
URI
\series default
 will exist due to the load profile under stressed conditions.
 Additionally, the fault contribution of the transmission lines will only
 affect the diameter 
\series bold
BA
\series default
 of zone 3 which will only affect point 
\series bold
U
\series default
.
 Point 
\series bold
U
\series default
 correspond to the max fault resistance.
 Stated differently, there will be always an overlap between the dynamic
 rating of the line and zone 3 and the short circuit levels from nearby
 lines will only affect the size of the overlap (area 
\series bold
URI)
\series default
 not the overlap itself.
 Another variation of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Distance-Relay-characteristic"

\end_inset

 is given explicitly in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "RN14"

\end_inset

, however the one given here is more general.
 Lastly, to derive 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:VoltageAtRelat"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:ApparentImpedanceAtRelay"

\end_inset

, a three phase fault has been assumed.
 Nevertheless, if a single line to ground fault occurs then the positive
 sequence impedance seen by the distance protection system will still be
 given by 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:ApparentImpedanceAtRelay"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should be apparent from the description above that the major issue that
 is faced by traditional impedance protection system is that the steady
 state impedance corresponding to a heavy load is coincident to the impedance
 under a fault on a remote line to which the distance protection system
 provides backup protection.
 It could be argued that impedance protection should be supervised by other
 steady state protection principles to enhance its selectivity, i.e, the
 ability to differentiate between a load and a fault current.
 However, other protection principles -such as over current protection-
 that can make the distinction between a load and a fault depend on the
 anticipated power flow for operation while the problem in hand is different.
 The confusion that is seen by the distance protection is because the power
 flow under system wide cascading failures changes considerably from the
 planned power flow.
 In other words, the load encroachment zone has to be set for system wide
 cascading scenarios that is not known in advance, which is close to impossible
 undertaking.
 One of the authors 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Horowitz2006"

\end_inset

 states this fact as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
"The overwhelming thrust of the NERC rules and other instructions regarding
 the application of zone 3 elements has been to prevent its operation during
 emergency conditions.
 Although this is a desirable goal, it should be recognized that even with
 all the intelligence available to modern computer relays, the problem of
 distinguishing a fault from a heavy load in a relatively short time and
 using only the current and voltage signals available to the relay can not
 be solved in every single imaginable (and some unimaginable) power system
 scenarios"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As shown above in the general formulation of the problem, a distance protection
 system may not be able to differentiate between a heavy line load and a
 fault if system is stressed enough to cause such confusion.
 Several approaches have been devised to solve the problem.
 The solutions proposed can be divided into two major categories:

\begin_layout Itemize
Detection and mitigation of cascading events in real time operations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the planning stage, the power system operator has access to all relay
 settings and system anticipated conditions ahead of time.
 Using the forecasted load conditions and system settings, distance protection
 misoperation can be anticipated and thus blocked before occurrence.

Most Independent System Operators (ISOs) today use N-1 criterion to judge
 whether the system is secure after the removal of one line in planning
 stage.
 However, given that distance protection system misoperation is not triggered
 until two or three lines go out of service

, the distribution of power flow is hard to be taken into account in the
 planning stage as it would mean performing N-2 and N-3 contingency analysis
 which is expensive computationally.
 Thus, it is increasingly hard to assess protection system capability under

Even though blackouts have hit North American and Europe and most of the
 world in the last century, the blackout of 2003 was determinantal in directing
 the scientific community into investigating the subject in detail, partly

 In the same year of 2003, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 was published to pinpoint which lines can cause the system to drift to
 a blackout.
 The idea in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 is that a probability function is defined that can be used in the planning
 stage to measure the failure probability of the system after certain number
 of lines are taken out of service sequentially.
 The system operator can issue a warning message in real time operations
 in case the scenarios identified in the planning stage occur during operations.
 The authors also showed that the probability is heavily dependent on the
 system dynamics and the operating point.
 The authors noted that the system behavior resemble the one with self-organized
 criticality, a concept that the authors explored in more detail in

 that the system is about the brink of collapse when a threshold is attained.
 A drawback of this approach is that it depends on the DC power flow whence
 the AC power flow should be used when the system is under stressed system
 conditions.
 Running an AC power flow in the planning stage requires more computational
 power.
 Mitigation of cascading events that lead to distance protection zone 3

 conditions and the likelihood of cascades.
 An index that is used to monitor distance relays is also proposed.
 However, in practice only N-1 contingencies are studied and thus the severity
 index is chosen based on that case.
 However, if the system enters N-2 or N-3 contingency conditions, tuning
 of the “severity” threshold will be a difficult task computationally.

 However, the paper uses the energy of the transformed signals which is
 likely to be confused for faults on adjacent lines.
 Since there seems to be no relation between the energy contained in the

The 2003 blackouts pointed out the importance of having events along with
 the time they occurred.
 Investigators spent much of their time trying to match up the waveforms
 to reconstruct the sequence of events that led to the blackout.
 It was then apparent that to facilitate the transfer and comparison of
 waveforms, all samples need to have a time stamp for this purpose.
 Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) or synchrophasor technology were then developed
 to address this shortcoming.
 By the time of 2003 blackout, state estimation was a very mature field,
 but PMUs opened new areas for the application of state estimation by reducing
 the time needed to do state estimation due to the wide spread deployment
 in the transmission network.
 A PMU measures the positive sequence voltage and current (magnitude and
 angles), which opens new areas for adaptive relaying and wide area control
 and protection

 In conventional protection schemes, the relay is only applied to the transmissi

 The essential feature of all PMU detection schemes is that using the communicat

 However, for the method to work, the minimum voltage threshold has to be
 established.
 It is shown in the paper that a voltage threshold less than 0.95 means that
 there is a fault on a system.

 However, for the trip command to be safe, large amount of offline simulations

 This in turn means that checking co-ordination with nearby distance protection
